# Design Works

Here are some of my design works done in a beginners' graphic design course.

- A self-designed [typeface](/public/design_works/typeface.pdf) called Hexagon.
- Six [patterns](/public/design_works/patterns.pdf) expressing Scale and Proportion, Radial Symmetry, Calm,
  Congestion, Stability, and Playfulness respectively.
- A set of [greeting cards](/public/design_works/greeting_cards.pdf) for four Chinese traditional festivals.
