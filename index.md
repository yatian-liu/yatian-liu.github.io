A senior undergraduate at the University of Michigan, majoring in
Computer Engineering. Interested in the field of human-computer interaction
and interactive embedded systems and currently working on relevant projects.

I transferred to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2019, and before that I
studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [UM-SJTU Joint
Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn) cofounded by Shanghai Jiao Tong
University and University of Michigan. The Joint Institute's dual degree program
provides me a precious opportunity to study at top research universities in both
China and the United States.

## Recent Projects

- Currently building an ultrasonic microphone array system for advanced sensing
  like accurate sound source localization at the [SPQR
  Lab](https://spqrlab1.github.io/). The project is led by PhD student Julia
  Lanier and directed by Prof. Kevin Fu and Alanson Sample. On an Intel Arria V
  FPGA, we finished developing and testing a digital signal processing system to
  convert PDM signals from multiple MEMS microphones to PCM signals in parallel
  and a subsystem to transmit the PCM signal samples to a computer via Ethernet.
  The detailed progress of the project can be seen from the blog posts.

- Almost done with a major design project for EECS 473, an embedded systems
  course from the University of Michigan! There is an [online project
  showcase](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/eecs-473-advanced-embedded-systems/) for
  all the projects in the Fall 2020 semester. I'm in the Door Display group, who
  developed a low-power door- or wall-mounted wireless information display
  powered by a solar panel and a battery. We initially aimed to make the display
  self-sustaining, but it turned out to be a too difficult goal. Nevertheless,
  we still managed to reach a battery life of more than one month. The details
  of our project are on the project showcase website.

## Personal Life

Besides my academic interest on human-computer interaction and embedded systems,
I'm also interested in general electronics such as headphones and cameras. I'm
an amateur photographer who like to use cameras to capture beautiful, memorable,
or emotional moments. Besides, I have a little experience in graphic design and
in particular really appreciate the beauty of typography (the logo below is
designed by me in a beginners' graphic design course!). I support the free
software movement and try to use proprietary software only when I really need
it.
