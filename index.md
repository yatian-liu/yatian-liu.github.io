A first-year Master's student at the University of Michigan, majoring in
Computer Science and Engineering. Interested in the field of human-computer
interaction and interactive embedded systems and currently working on relevant
projects.

I transferred to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2019, and before that I
studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [UM-SJTU Joint
Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn) cofounded by Shanghai Jiao Tong
University and University of Michigan. The Joint Institute's dual degree program
provides me a precious opportunity to study at top research universities in both
China and the United States. I got my bachelor's degree from both UM and SJTU in
April 2021 and August 2021 respectively.

## Recent Projects

- Currently building an ultrasonic microphone array system for advanced acoustic
  sensing like accurate sound source localization at the [SPQR
  Lab](https://spqrlab1.github.io/). The project was led by PhD student Julia
  Lanier and now another Master's student and I are mainly working on it. It is
  directed by Prof. Kevin Fu and Alanson Sample. On an Intel Arria V FPGA, we
  finished developing and testing a digital signal processing system to convert
  PDM signals from multiple MEMS microphones to PCM signals in parallel and a
  subsystem to transmit the PCM signal samples to a computer using UDP packets
  via Ethernet. Later, we extended and ported the code to an Intel DE-10 board
  that has an ARM hard core and can run Linux, simplifying software development
  and network stack management. The system is currently able to process and
  transmit data from 49 microphones in parallel. The detailed progress of the
  project can be seen from the [blog posts](/posts) (Updated in December 2020).

- In Fall 2020, finished a major design project for EECS 473, an embedded
  systems course from the University of Michigan. There is an [online project
  showcase](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/eecs-473-advanced-embedded-systems/) for
  all the projects. I'm in the Door Display group, who developed a low-power
  door- or wall-mounted wireless information display powered by a solar panel
  and a battery. We initially aimed to make the display self-sustaining, but it
  turned out to be a too difficult goal. Nevertheless, we still managed to reach
  a battery life of more than one month. The details of our project are on the
  project showcase website.

## Personal Life

Besides my academic interest on human-computer interaction and embedded systems,
I'm also interested in general electronics such as headphones and cameras. I'm
an amateur photographer who like to use cameras to capture beautiful, memorable,
or emotional moments. Besides, I have a little experience in graphic design and
in particular really appreciate the beauty of typography (the logo below is
designed by me in a beginners' graphic design course!). Some of my photographs
and design works are given on the [Artistic Works](/artistic_works) page. In
addition, I support the free software movement and try to use proprietary
software only when I really need it.
